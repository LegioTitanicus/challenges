A deck of 52 cards is created, and a message should appear to confirm the deck's creation.
Two hands of four cards should be created, one for player 1, and the other for player 2.
As the cards are dealt, a user should see a list of these cards output to the screen.
Once all of the cards are dealt, a user should see the total values of each hand. The value of the hand is the sum value of its cards.
The player with the highest hand value wins the game.
Output should be given that shows which player won the game.
If the hand values are the same, a user should see the output "TIE!"
